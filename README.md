# Prey and Predator Game (Summer-Research-2024)

Acknowledgements: I collaborated on this project with my research partner, Jio Hong. We also got guidance, and discussed ideas about our project with our reserach advisor, Fernanda Eliott.  

Short Description: This is a Prey and Predator Game based on the idea of the Pursuit Domain. The predators' goal is to capture the prey. The prey is captured in the middle when 4 predators surround it, on the edge when 3 predators surround it, and in the corner when 2 predators surround it. The game always runs for 20 steps. If the prey is captured during these 20 steps, then the game resets where the prey and predators are back in their original locations, and the game keeps running until the 20 steps are completed. 


Insturctions for Running the Program: Open the PlayGame.java file and run the program to see how the predators are capturing the prey. If you want to adjust the size of the grid, you must edit the GRID_SIZE variable in the NewGrid.java file.
